## Overview

This Employee Management System is a simple web application built with React and Redux, designed to manage employee information. It allows users to add new employees, view the list of employees, and edit or delete existing employee details.

## Features

### Add Employee

In the "Add Employee" section:
- Users can input employee details such as Full Name, Birthdate, Department, and Experience.

- Displays a table containing a list of employees with columns for Full Name, Department, and Experience.
- Each row in the table includes "Edit" and "Delete" buttons.
- Hovering over a row highlights it with a different color for better user experience.

### Edit Employee

- Clicking the "Edit" button in the employee list navigates to an edit page.
- On the edit page, the user can modify employee details such as Full Name, Birthdate, Department, and Experience.
- The "Cancel" button allows users to discard changes and go back to the employee list.
